#### What the scores mean

- **Fail** – Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background. You probably want to make it darker. This is a score of less than **3.0**.
- **AA Large** – The smallest acceptable amount of contrast for type sizes of 18pt and larger. This is a score of at least **3.0**.
- **AA** – This is the sweet spot for text sizes below ~18pt. This is a score of at least **4.5**.
- **AAA** – This is enhanced contrast with a score of at least **7.0**. Think longer form articles that will be read for a significant period of time.
